<b>Note: I don't continue any more supporting this project.</b>

# Environments
- Unity: 2019.1.8
- [MRTKv2 RC2](https://github.com/microsoft/MixedRealityToolkit-Unity/releases/tag/v2.0.0-RC2.1)

# How to use this project
Import MRTK, then build the scene "Sample.scene" with Android target.

# Future Work
In this project, I used UnityEngine.XR API for MRTK extension. However, some input key buttons of Oclus Quest are not supported in Unity so 
I rewriting all of my codes using <b>Oculus Integration</b> in other workspace.
